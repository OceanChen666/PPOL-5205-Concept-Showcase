# Tutorial of Cluster Analysis -Offshore Oil Platform Use case

Hi! 

In this article, we will delve into what cluster analysis entails, 
how it is used in public infrastructure data, and how hyperparameters
change the clustering result.

We will go over three main cluster analysis algorithm, K-mean, AHC and DCSCAN
step by step. In each algorithm page, we will also use the US Offshore Oil Platform data 
as a usecase to show how the change of hyperparameter affect the cluster results.

Finally, we will extract insights from the result of clustering analysis
## Overview


## Why offshore platform is a good usecase for cluster?
Offshore oil platforms hold a critical position in the global energy and economic framework. Their substantial contribution to worldwide oil production is indispensable for myriad industries and power generation, underpinning both economic growth and employment across sectors. Furthermore, the strategic importance of offshore oil in bolstering energy security cannot be overstated. By diversifying the sources of oil, these platforms mitigate the risk associated with over-reliance on a single geographical area or resource, thus ensuring a more stable and reliable energy supply.

Technologically, the offshore oil sector stands at the forefront of innovation. The challenges inherent in deep-water exploration have catalyzed significant advancements in drilling technology and safety mechanisms, which have wider applicative benefits beyond the industry, particularly in marine sciences and environmental monitoring. While environmental concerns associated with offshore drilling are valid, it's imperative to acknowledge the industry's progressive strides towards implementing stricter safety standards and developing technologies aimed at minimizing ecological impacts.

In the context of a gradual global shift towards renewable energy, offshore oil remains a crucial component of the current energy landscape. It serves as a transitional energy source, pivotal during this period of adaptation and development of renewable technologies.

From a public policy perspective, the use of cluster analysis in examining offshore oil platforms presents a compelling case. This analytical approach is adept at dissecting complex and multifaceted data, thereby enabling a deeper understanding of operational efficiencies, environmental impacts, and safety compliance. The application of cluster analysis in this domain can lead to more informed decision-making, optimizing resource utilization, enhancing safety measures, and fostering environmental responsibility. Such data-driven insights are essential for policy development, ensuring that offshore oil extraction is conducted in a manner that balances economic needs with environmental stewardship and public safety.
